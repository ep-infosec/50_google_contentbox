Description:
The modeltranslation application can be used to translate dynamic content of
existing models to an arbitrary number of languages without having to change the
original model classes. It uses a registration approach (comparable to Djangoâ€™s
admin app) to be able to add translations to existing or new projects and is
fully integrated into the Django admin backend.
