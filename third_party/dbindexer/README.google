Description:
With django-dbindexer you can emulate SQL features on NoSQL databases. For
example, if your database doesn’t support case-insensitive queries (iexact,
istartswith, etc.) you can just tell the indexer which models and fields should
support these queries and it’ll take care of maintaining the required indexes
for you. Magically, the previously unsupported queries will just work.
Currently, this project is in a very early development stage. The long-term plan
is to support JOINs and at least some simple aggregates, possibly even much
more.
